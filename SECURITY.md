This package is the **Starter Theme** for
[Nioteq CMS](https://github.com/tklmn/nioteq-cms). It is a front-end theme
(Blade views + assets) rendered by the CMS and inherits the host's security
controls (nonce-based CSP, CSRF, security headers).

latest release rather than expecting back-ported patches.
